# CSSS Documentation

## Why?
- The main purpose is to prevent cheating, whether that be through patching packet tracer or any other means. If there are any vulns you would like to report pls dm me at ``a_person9852`` on discord.
- Labs and quizes in the same place
- There is a leaderboard wow so cool competition
- You can customize feedback, like score or check messages.
- (Hopefully) better grading system with [CSSS Config Builder](https://github.com/Orionband/csss-config-builder), especially through "Show Differences Only"

## Running the Server
1.  `npm install`
2.  `node quickstart.js` (setup)
3.  `npm start`
4.  Access at `http://localhost:3000`

## 1. Packet Tracer Labs (`lab.conf`)
It's toml cuz aeacus


Defined in `[[labs]]` blocks.

### Lab Settings
You can customize resource usage and attempt limits per lab:
```toml
[[labs]]
id = "lab1_basic"
title = "Basic Lab"
max_submissions = 3
max_upload_mb = 10
max_xml_output_mb = 150
rate_limit_count = 5
rate_limit_window_seconds = 60
```

### Lab Check Types

You can append **`Not`** to any check type to invert the logic (Pass if the condition is **FALSE**).

#### 1. ConfigMatch / ConfigMatchNot
Checks if a specific line exists (or does not exist) exactly as written.

**Example: Simple hostname check**
```toml
[[labs.checks]]
message = "Hostname Configured"
points = 5
device = "CPD"
    [[labs.checks.pass]]
    type = "ConfigMatch"
    source = "running"
    context = "global"
    value = "hostname CPD"
```

#### 2. ConfigRegex / ConfigRegexNot
Checks if a line matches (or does not match) a Regex pattern.

#### 3. XmlMatch / XmlMatchNot
Checks specific hardware/XML properties.

**Example: Check Switch Model**
```toml
[[labs.checks]]
message = "Correct Switch Model (2960-24TT)"
points = 5
device = "Branch-Switch"
    [[labs.checks.pass]]
    type = "XmlMatch"
    # Path: <TYPE> -> 1st Item -> Attributes ($) -> model
    path = ["TYPE", "0", "$", "model"]
    value = "2960-24TT"
```

#### 4. XmlRegex / XmlRegexNot
Use this to check if a value inside the XML matches a pattern (e.g., Serial Numbers, MAC Addresses).

#### 5. Type5Match / Type5MatchNot
Use this to securely check MD5 (Type 5) encrypted passwords in the configuration without hardcoding the salt/hash in the grader configuration. 

**Device Mode (enable secret):**
```toml
[[labs.checks]]
message = "Enable secret skibidi"
points = 10
device = "R1"
    [[labs.checks.pass]]
    type = "Type5Match"
    mode = "device"
    password = "skibidi"
    source = "running"
    context = "global"
```

**User Mode (username &lt;user&gt; secret):**
```toml
[[labs.checks]]
message = "Admin user has correct password"
points = 10
device = "R1"
    [[labs.checks.pass]]
    type = "Type5Match"
    mode = "user"
    username = "admin"
    password = "secretpassword"
    source = "startup"
    context = "global"
```

### Contexts
Where the grader looks for the config:
- `global`: Top level (hostname, ip route).
- `interface [name]`: Inside an interface block.
- `router [proto]`: Inside a routing block.

### When distributing the packet tracer file, **ensure the answer network is deleted/replaced** inside the PKA activity wizard.

## 2. Quizzes (`quiz.conf`)

Defined in `[[quizzes]]` blocks.

### Quiz Question Types

*   **radio**: Single choice.
*   **checkbox**: Multiple correct answers.
*   **text**: Regex-validated text input.
*   **matching**: Drag and drop terms.

### Quiz Exhibits (Images & PKA Files)
You can attach an image or a downloadable `.pka` file to **any** question.

To prevent cheating (IDOR/URL guessing), assets must be placed inside the **`protected/`** directory at the root of your server, *not* in the public folder.
1. Images go in `protected/images/`
2. Packet Tracer exhibits go in `protected/pka/`

```toml
[[quizzes.questions]]
text = "Based on the provided Packet Tracer file and diagram, what is the IP address of Router A?"
type = "radio"
image = "topology.png"    # Placed in protected/images/topology.png
pka = "lab_scenario.pka"  # Placed in protected/pka/lab_scenario.pka
    [[quizzes.questions.answers]]
    text = "192.168.1.1"
    correct = true
```

## Server-Sided Security
*   **No Answers on Client**: All grading logic (`grading.js`) runs in a hidden worker thread on the server.
*   **Input Blocking**: Quizzes disable Copy/Paste, and lock inputs permanently upon submission to prevent tampering.
*   **Protected Assets**: Quiz Exhibits (Images/PKA) are hidden behind a secure API. They cannot be downloaded unless the user is logged in, and the file belongs to an actively `enabled` quiz.
*   **Sanitized Payloads**: If score display is disabled, the server scrubs the score data entirely from the socket stream.
*   **TOCTOU Mitigations**: Global memory locks prevent race-condition exploits to bypass `max_submissions`.

## Free Servers & Configuration Builder
*   You can deploy CSSS to [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) or [Render](https://render.com/).
*   Use [cron-job.org](https://console.cron-job.org/login) to ping the server every 10 minutes to prevent sleeping.
*   User [CSSS Config Builder](https://github.com/Orionband/csss-config-builder) to easily generate your `lab.conf` and `quiz.conf` files.
